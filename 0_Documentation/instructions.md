# How to build yourself an STS-Measurement device
1. Start by collecting all the required components:
- Arduino Nano V3
- DS18B20 Temperature Probe
- DHT11 Humidity/Temperature-Sensor
- 10k + 4.7k Resistor
- Soldering equipment
- Prototyping board: Size 5*8 cm, cut in half
- Pin headers
- 3 * M2x10mm screws
2. Solder the parts to the prototyping board in accordance with the schematic:
![Schematic for the project](https://github.com/PaulGoldschmidt/STS/blob/main/1_Hardware/schematic.jpg)
3. Flash Arduino with the newest software from this repo
4. Print the enclosure (size: 100%, PLA/PETG)
5. Test the hardware!
6. Using a little bit of hotglue, put the display in the enclosure
7. Lay the rest of the hardware in the enclosure
8. Test it one last time
9. Congratulations: You're done!
